Student System
-------------------------
You are given a working project for a small Student System, but the code is very poorly organized. Break up the code logically into smaller functional units – methods and classes and don’t break the functionality.
The program supports the following commands:
•	“Create <studentName> <studentAge> <studentGrade>” – creates a new student and adds them to the repository.
•	“Show <studentName>” – prints on the console information about a student in the format:
“<studentName> is <studentAge> years old. <commentary>”, where the commentary is based on the student’s grade.
•	“Exit” – closes the program.
Do not add any extra validation or functionality to the app!
