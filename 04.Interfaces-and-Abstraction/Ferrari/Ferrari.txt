Ferrari
-----------------------------------
Model an application which contains a class Ferrari and an interface. Your task is simple, you have a car - Ferrari, its model is "488-Spider" and it has a driver. Your Ferrari should have functionality to use brakes and push the gas pedal. When the brakes are pushed down print "Brakes!", and when the gas pedal is pushed down - "Zadu6avam sA!". As you may have guessed this functionality is typical for all cars, so you should implement an interface to describe it.

<<Interface>>
Car
+ brakes() : String
+ gas() : String

Your task is to create a Ferrari and set the driver's name to the passed one in the input. After that, print the info. Take a look at the Examples to understand the task better.
