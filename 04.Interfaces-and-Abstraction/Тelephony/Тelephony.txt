They agree and you start working on the project. The project consists of one main model - a Smartphone. Each of your smartphones should have functionalities of calling other phones and browsing in the world wide web.
Your friends are very busy, so you decide to write the code on your own. Here is the mandatory assignment:
You should have a model - Smartphone and two separate functionalities which your smartphone has - to call other phones and to browse in the world wide web. You should end up with one class and two interfaces.
