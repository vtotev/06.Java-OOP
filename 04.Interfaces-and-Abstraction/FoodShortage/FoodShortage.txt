Food Shortage
--------------------------------
Your totalitarian dystopian society suffers a shortage of food, so many rebels appear. Extend the code from your previous (Problem 2.Multiple Implementation) task with new functionality to solve this task.
Define a class Rebel which has a name, age and group (String), names are unique - there will never be 2 Rebels/Citizens or a Rebel and Citizen with the same name. Define an interface Buyer which defines a methods buyFood() and a getFood(). Implement the Buyer interface in the Citizen and Rebel class, both Rebels and Citizens start with 0 food, when a Rebel buys food his food increases by 5, when a Citizen buys food his food increases by 10.
On the first line of the input you will receive an integer N - the number of people, on each of the next N lines you will receive information in one of the following formats "<name> <age> <id> <birthdate>" for a Citizen or 
"<name> <age><group>" for a Rebel. After the N lines until the command "End" is received, you will receive names of people who bought food, each on a new line. Note that not all names may be valid, in case of an incorrect name - nothing should happen.
On the only line of output, you should print the total amount of food purchased.
