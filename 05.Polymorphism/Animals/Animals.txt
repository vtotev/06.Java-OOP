Animals
---------------------------
Create a class Animal, which holds two fields:
•	name: String
•	favouriteFood: String
Animal has one abstract method explainSelf(): String.
You should add two new classes - Cat and Dog. Override the explainSelf() method by adding concrete animal sound on a new line. (Look at examples below)

You should be able to use the class like this:
---------------------------
Main
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal cat = new Cat("Oscar", "Whiskas");
    Animal dog = new Dog("Rocky", "Meat");
    System.out.println(cat.explainSelf());
    System.out.println(dog.explainSelf());
}

Examples

Input	Output
---------------------------
	I am Oscar and my favourite food is Whiskas
	MEEOW
	I am Rocky and my favourite food is Meat
	DJAAF
