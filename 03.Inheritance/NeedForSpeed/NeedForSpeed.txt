Need for Speed
------------------
NOTE: You need a public class Main. Create the following hierarchy with the following classes:  

		     ______________ Vehicle________
		    /\	         		  /\
	   _____Motorcycle___		     _____Car____
	  /\		    /\		    /\		/\
    RaceMotorcycle    CrossMotorcycle    FamilyCar   SportCar


Create a base class Vehicle. It should contain the following members:
•	DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION – final static double (constant)
•	fuelConsumption –double
•	fuel – double
•	horsePower – int
•	Getters and Setters for the fields
•	A public constructor which accepts (fuel, horsePower) and set the default fuel consumption on the field fuelConsumption
•	void drive(double kilometers)
o	The drive method should have a functionality to reduce the fuel based on the travelled kilometers and fuel consumption. Keep in mind that you can drive the vehicle only if you have enough fuel to finish the driving.
The default fuel consumption for Vehicle is 1.25. Some of the classes have different default fuel consumption:
•	SportCar – DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 10
•	RaceMotorcycle – DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 8
•	Car – DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION = 3
Zip your package and upload it in Judge.

Hint	
------------------
In the child classes' constructors use super.setFuelConsumption() to set fuelConsumption
