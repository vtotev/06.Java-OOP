Hierarchical Inheritance
---------------------------
Create three classes named Animal, Dog and Cat. 
Animal with a single public method eat() that prints: "eating…"
Dog with a single public method bark() that prints: "barking…"
Cat with a single public method meow() that prints: "meowing…"
Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.
