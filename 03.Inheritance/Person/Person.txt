Person
---------------------
NOTE: You need a public class Main. Create a package person.
You are asked to model an application for storing data about people. You should be able to have a Person and a Child. The child derives from the person. Every person has a name, and an age. Your task is to model the application.
The Person class also have getters for the fields.
Create a Child class that inherits Person and has the same public constructor definition. However, do not copy the code from the Person class - reuse the Person class's constructor.


Sample Main()
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String name = sc.nextLine();
        int age = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());

        Child child = new Child(name, age);

        System.out.println(child.getName());
        System.out.println(child.getAge());
    }
}
