Class Box
---------------------------
You are given a geometric figure Box with fields length, width and height. Model a class Box that can be instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral surface area and its volume (formulas: http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm).
On the first three lines you will get the length, width and height. On the next three lines print the surface area, lateral surface area and the volume of the box.
A box’s side should not be zero or a negative number. Add data validation for each parameter given to the constructor. Make a private setter that performs data validation internally.
